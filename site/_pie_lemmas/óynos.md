lemma_to_sort: "oynos"
klass: numeral
etymology: ["Perhaps built on the pronominal stem *éy (“he, she, it”) +‎ *-nós, in which case the suffix would have been used in contradiction to its presumed usage. Homer's use of feminine ἴα (ía, “one”), from *ih₂, directly from the pronominal stem *i- has been suggested as a corroboration for this.", "Alternative forms in PIE include *Hóywos, attested in Greek and Indo-Iranian (cf. Ancient Greek οἶος (oîos),  Avestan 𐬀𐬉𐬎𐬎𐬀‎ (aēuua)) and *Hóykos, attested only in Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit एक (éka))."]
