klass: noun
etymology: ["From *weh‚ÇÅy- (‚Äúto twine, wind‚Äù) +‚Äé *-tis. The reconstruction of the underlying root is heavily debated. Beekes, De Vaan, and Derksen all reconstruct *weh‚ÇÅi-, each using the oblique, zero-grade stem (*uh‚ÇÅi-ti-) as the etymon for the Hellenic, Italic, and Balto-Slavic branches respectively. Fortson agrees that the oblique, zero-grade stems of many nouns in *-tis and *-tus were generalized in Indo-Aryan, Hellenic, and many other branches. Other examples include:", "*b ∞√©rtis > *b ∞≈ïÃ•tis ‚Üí Old Armenian ’¢’°÷Ä’§ (bard), Celtic *britis (Old Irish brith, Middle Welsh bryd), Germanic *bur√æiz, Italic *forts (Latin fors), Sanskrit ‡§≠‡•É‡§§‡§ø (bhrÃ•t√≠)\n*p√©rtus > *p≈ïÃ•tus ‚Üí Celtic *…∏ritus (Brythonic *rr…®d), Germanic *furduz, Iranian *prÃ•tu≈° (Avestan ê¨ûê¨Üê¨≠ê¨Üê¨ôê¨é‚Äé (p…ôr…ôtu)), Italic *portus", "Matasoviƒá instead reconstructs *weyh‚ÇÅ-, pointing out that, in Celtic, a laryngeal is lost after the diphthong -ey- and before a consonant (/eyHC/ ‚Üí /eyC/) and also that -ey- regularly becomes -ƒì-. However, given the evidence of other Celtic nouns derived from  *-tis and *-tus (*b ∞√©rtis > *britis, *«µ√©wstus > *gustus, *p√©rtus > *…∏ritus), Celtic also appears to favor the zero-grade for these nouns, making the reconstruction *w√©yh‚ÇÅtis untenable. It is unclear whether *uh‚ÇÅ√≠tis regularly gives Celtic *wƒìtis, but *wih‚ÇÅ-, the zero-grade of *weyh‚ÇÅ-, certainly would not.", "The LIV in turn reconstructs *wyeh‚ÇÅ- for the verbs meaning ‚Äúto wrap, twine‚Äù (Latin vie≈ç, Sanskrit ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø (vy√°yati), Slavic *viti); though De Vaan rejects this proposal."]
