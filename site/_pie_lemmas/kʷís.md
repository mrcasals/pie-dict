title: "*kʷís"
permalink: "/pie/pronoun/kʷís"
lemma_to_sort: "kʷis"
klass: pronoun
etymology: ["A PIE interrogative-indefinite paradigm built from the stems *kʷi- and *kʷe- (parallel to anaphoric i-, e-), the former on nom. and acc. cases of all genders, the latter elsewhere, with no distinction of feminine forms, mostly \"human\" – \"non-human\". A stem *kʷo-, an o-stem adjective, with its corresponding feminine *kʷeh₂-, was originally separate, but in most languages there was some conflation with the other two, as it is from this function that the relative pronoun evolves. Ultimately from *kʷ-."]
