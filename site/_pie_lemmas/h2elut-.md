klass: noun
etymology: ["According to some the original meaning was \"a bitter drink\" and is related to Latin alūmen (“alum”) and Ancient Greek ἀλύδοιμος (alúdoimos, “bitter, pungent”).", "Another theory is that it is connected to Proto-Norse ᚨᛚᚢ (alu, “something magical”), and related to Latvian aluot (“be distraught”), Ancient Greek ἀλύω (alúō, “to be distraught”) and Hittite [script needed] (alwanzaḫḫ-, “to bewitch, hex”). EIEC explains the semantic connection as: The notion would be that beer induced a \"high\" wherein the drinker was infused with a sort of magical power.", "The most recent theory is that it is related to Sanskrit अरुष (aruṣá, “reddish”) and Avestan 𐬀𐬎𐬭𐬎𐬱𐬀‎ (auruša, “bright, white”), from which Proto-Indo-Iranian *Harušás can be reconstructed from the two languages. Compare also Albanian all (“of reddish colour”)."]
