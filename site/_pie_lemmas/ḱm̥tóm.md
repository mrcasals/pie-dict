etymology: ["Some sort of derivation from *déḱm̥ (“ten”) (with Pre-IE *d lost or merged with *h₁ in the same way the initial dental obstruent was lost in the oblique cases of *dʰéǵʰōm (“earth”)), perhaps its ordinal number (*déḱm̥ +‎ *-ó-). If so then this could come from some phrase, \"tenth\", whose substantive noun can only be conjectured."]
