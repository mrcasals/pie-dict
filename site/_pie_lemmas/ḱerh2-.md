klass: root
etymology: ["Potentially a collective derivation in *-h₂ from *ḱer- (“horn”). A possible loan relation with Proto-Semitic *ḳarn- (“horn”) has also been suggested. However, it is probably unrelated with Old Chinese 觡 (*kraːg, “antler”) and 觥 (*kʷraːŋ, “drinking vessel made of animal horn”) despite the phonological and semantic  resemblance between the three."]
