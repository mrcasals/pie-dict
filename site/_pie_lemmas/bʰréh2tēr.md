lemma_to_sort: "bʰreh₂ter"
klass: noun
etymology: ["This lexeme is widespread, though absent from Albanian and rare in Anatolian. Because it means \"kinsman\" in Greek, and meant both \"brother\" and \"kinsman, cousin\"  (or \"comrade\") in Celtic (e.g. Old Irish bráthair) and Baltic (e.g. in Latvian and Old Prussian), some suspect it had similarly wider meaning in PIE (even in English \"brother\" is often used to refer to socially-affiliated non-relatives)."]
