klass: noun
etymology: ["From *dʰeǵʰ- +‎ *-ōm.", "However, Kloekhorst argues that the Sanskrit and Anatolian evidence point towards a reconstruction of the root *dʰeǵ- as opposed to *dʰeǵʰ- on the basis that:", "In the Sanskrit oblique stem jm-, -j- must reflect *ǵ-, and cannot reflect *ǵʰ-, which would regularly give -h- in all positions.\nThe long vowel in the Hittite nom. sg. [tēkan] suggests a \"voiced unaspirated\" (pre-glottalised) velar. See Kloekhorst (2012).\nThe *ǵʰ- reconstructable from Latin, Germanic and Greek can be explained in the glottalic theory as a simplification of the cluster *dʰǵ /dˀɡ/ to *dʰǵʰ /dɡ/. The opposite development is much less likely.", "It should be noted, however, that the glottalic theory is not generally accepted.", "A phonetically difficult, but possible connection is with *(s)teǵ- (“to cover”), with devoicing of *dʰ to *t via Siebs' law."]
