klass: numeral
etymology: ["Usually explained as a derivation from the words for \"fist\" and \"finger\":", "Proto-Indo-European *pn̥kʷ-sti-s (“fist”) > Proto-Germanic *funhstiz > *funstiz > Proto-West Germanic *fūsti (> Old English fȳst (“fist”), Old Frisian fest (“fist”), Old High German fūst (“fist”))\nProto-Indo-European *penkʷ-ró-s (“finger”) > Proto-Germanic *fingraz (“finger”) (> Gothic 𐍆𐌹𐌲𐌲𐍂𐍃 (figgrs, “finger”), Old Norse fingr, Old English finger, Old High German finger)", "Ultimately all of these forms may go back to a verbal stem *penkʷ- (“to take in hand, to handle”), though such a verb is not attested in any of the daughter languages. In contrast, Blažek (1999: 229) argues that the meanings \"fist”, etc. are primary. A relation to *ponkʷ-to- (“all, whole”) has also been suggested, possibly seen in Latin cūnctus and Hittite 𒉺𒀭𒆪𒍑 (pa-an-ku-uš, “family”), thus *pénkʷe meaning \"the whole (hand)\"."]
