lemma_to_sort: "h₂ŕ̥tk'os"
klass: noun
etymology: ["The word is either a nominalization of an unattested adjective *h₂r̥tḱós (“destroying”) or a derivative of *h₂rétḱ-os ~ *h₂rétḱ-es- (“destruction”) (cf. Avestan 𐬭𐬀𐬱𐬀𐬵‎ (rašah), Sanskrit रक्षस् (rákṣas)).", "In late PIE (i.e. post-Anatolian period), the word metathesized into *h₂ŕ̥ḱtos which phonetically surfaced as *h₂ŕ̥ḱþos following the rule that when dental and velar occlusives appear syllable-initially, they metathesize tk → kt and turn into a thorn cluster denoted ḱþ.  See Wikipedia for a discussion of these clusters' makeup."]
