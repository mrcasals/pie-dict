permalink: "/pie/noun/nókʷts"
lemma_to_sort: "nokʷts"
klass: noun
etymology: ["Pooth argues that the word derives from *negʷ- (“bare, naked”), and that the ablaut variants *nékʷt-, *nókʷt- should be analyzed as two separate words, *négʷts and *nógʷts, root nouns meaning \"dusk\" and \"night\" respectively, or originally \"getting bare (of sunlight)\" (action noun) and \"the result of getting bare (of sunlight)\" (noun with detransitive or middle meaning marked by the vowel *o). This analysis differs from the traditional one, in which *nékʷt-, *nókʷt- are simply ablaut variants used in different parts of the nominal paradigm, with no difference in meaning."]
