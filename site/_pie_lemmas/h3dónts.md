klass: noun
etymology: ["This noun is usually reconstructed with the initial *h₁ and thus explained as active participle of the verb *h₁ed- (“to eat”). However, Aeolic ἔδοντες (édontes) appears to be a folk-etymological adaptation to ἔδω (édō), and the initial ἔ- is hence no evidence for *h₁-. Old Armenian ատամն (atamn) also points to *h₃-, as well as a prefixed Greek derivative νωδός (nōdós), which requires *n̥-h₃d- (where */h₃/ was regularly vocalized to ό in interconsonantal position). Thus, the word is ultimately an active participle of the root *h₃ed- (“to bite”) +‎ *-ónts."]
