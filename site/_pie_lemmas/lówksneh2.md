lemma_to_sort: "lowksneh₂"
klass: noun
etymology: ["From *lewk- (“to shine”) +‎ *-sneh₂. Alternatively from *lewk-s- +‎ *-néh₂, from the s-stem of the same root (compare Proto-Indo-Iranian *ráwčas (“day; light”)). In this case, originally a substantivized adjective *lewksnós or *lowksnós (“shiny, bright”) (compare Middle High German liehsen (“bright”) from *léwksnos, Ancient Greek λύχνος (lúkhnos, “lamp”) from *luksnos), as the divergent meanings of Avestan, Persian and Old Prussian indicate, and the fact that Iranian has cognates that are adjectives, not nouns. The original Proto-Indo-European lexeme for \"moon\" was apparently *mḗh₁n̥s, and *lówksneh₂ may have originated as a later poetic synonym."]
