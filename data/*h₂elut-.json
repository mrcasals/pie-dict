  "etymology": [
    "According to some the original meaning was \"a bitter drink\" and is related to Latin alūmen (“alum”) and Ancient Greek ἀλύδοιμος (alúdoimos, “bitter, pungent”).[1]\n",
    "Another theory is that it is connected to Proto-Norse ᚨᛚᚢ (alu, “something magical”), and related to Latvian aluot (“be distraught”), Ancient Greek ἀλύω (alúō, “to be distraught”) and Hittite [script needed] (alwanzaḫḫ-, “to bewitch, hex”).[2] EIEC explains the semantic connection as: The notion would be that beer induced a \"high\" wherein the drinker was infused with a sort of magical power.\n",
    "The most recent theory is that it is related to Sanskrit अरुष (aruṣá, “reddish”) and Avestan 𐬀𐬎𐬭𐬎𐬱𐬀‎ (auruša, “bright, white”), from which Proto-Indo-Iranian *Harušás can be reconstructed from the two languages.[3] Compare also Albanian all (“of reddish colour”).\n"
