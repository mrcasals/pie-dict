    "Compare Arabic نَشَم‎ (našam, “elm”), which points to the Proto-Semitic form *Caśam-, the middle consonant of which is the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative /ɬ/, however possibly not found in Semitic except in Arabic; likely a wanderwort.\nThe same match pertains to Old Armenian թեղի (tʿełi, “elm”) and Ancient Greek πτελέα (pteléa, “wych-elm”)"
