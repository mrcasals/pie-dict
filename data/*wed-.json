  "lemma": "*wed-",
  "etymology": [
    "Possibly related to Proto-Uralic *wete, the source of Finnish vesi and Hungarian víz. The nature of the relationship is unclear and controversial; the word may have been borrowed from Proto-Indo-European into Proto-Uralic, or the reverse. A minority of linguists suggests a common origin from an even earlier proto-language, but this is not generally accepted.",
    "In Proto-Indo-European, the active elemental *wed- (“water”) was contrasted with the passive *h₂ep- (“body of water”), similar to the opposition of the active \"fire\" *h₁n̥gʷnis with the passive *péh₂wr̥."
