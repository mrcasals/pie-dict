    "Disputed; possibly from *weh₁y- (“to twist; to wrap”) +‎ *-ō, compare Ancient Greek ὑιήν (huiḗn, “grapevine”), from *wihy-ḗn, and Latin vītis (“vine”), from *wéh₁itis, or perhaps borrowed from either Proto-West Semitic *wayn- or Proto-Kartvelian *ɣwino-, if those terms are not instead borrowings of this one. Possibly all ultimately borrowed from an unattested Mediterranean substrate language."
