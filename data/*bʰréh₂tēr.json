  "etymology": [
    "This lexeme is widespread, though absent from Albanian[1][2] and rare in Anatolian.[1] Because it means \"kinsman\" in Greek,[1][2] and meant both \"brother\" and \"kinsman, cousin\"  (or \"comrade\") in Celtic (e.g. Old Irish bráthair) and Baltic (e.g. in Latvian and Old Prussian),[2] some suspect it had similarly wider meaning in PIE (even in English \"brother\" is often used to refer to socially-affiliated non-relatives).[2]\n"
