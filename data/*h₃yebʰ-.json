  "etymology": [
    "Originally meant \"to enter, penetrate\" with a semantic narrowing to \"copulate\". The original meaning can be seen in Luwian [script needed] (˚ipatarma-, “west”), [script needed] (˚iparwašša/i-, “western”) (< pre-form *ipa- (“west, sunset”)), Tocharian A yäw-, Tocharian B yäp- (“to enter, set (of sun)”); see also Ancient Greek Ζέφῠρος (Zéphuros, “west wind”), ζόφος (zóphos, “darkness, gloom; the dark quarter, the west”) . The semantic specialization was confined to the central and eastern parts of the IE speech community, and did not affect either Tocharian or Anatolian, and has left no trace in the West IE."
