    "Found only in West Indo-European languages, namely the Italic, Celtic and Germanic branches. Perhaps derived from *peh₂- (“to feed, to guard, to nourish”) and thus cognate to Proto-Slavic *piťa (“food”), Sanskrit पितु (pitu, “food”), Lithuanian piẽtūs (“lunch”), Old Irish ith (“corn”), Latin pānis (“bread”), English food and German Futter (“fodder”).",
