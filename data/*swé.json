  "lemma": "*swé",
  "etymology": [
    "This stem (and its substantive pronoun) was originally a reflexive element referring to all persons and numbers (as in Sanskrit and in Balto-Slavic). Its wider use can still be seen in Homer, when ὅς (hós) means \"my own\" or \"your own\" (e.g. Odyssey 11.142, 9.28)."
