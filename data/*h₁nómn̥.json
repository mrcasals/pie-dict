  "etymology": [
    "Kloekhorst 2008:518 argues for a *-mn̥ derivative of the root *h₃neh₃- (“to name”), reflected in Hittite [script needed] (ḫannai-, “to sue, judge”) (originally \"to call to court\") and Ancient Greek ὄνομαι (ónomai, “to blame, scold, insult”) (with a semantic shift comparable to English to call names); see also *h₃en(h₂)-.\n",
    "Within the disputed Indo-Uralic theory, it has been connected with the Uralic root *nime, whence Finnish nimi, Estonian nimi and Hungarian név.\n"
