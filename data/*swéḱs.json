{
  "lemma": "*swéḱs",
  "etymology": [
    "Given the attested forms in the daughter languages, some have proposed that the original form was *wéḱs (whence Armenian, Old Prussian and possibly Ancient Greek). The initial *s- would then be secondary (imported from *septḿ̥), and when it was just added the result was *swéḱs (Celtic, Iranian, and Ancient Greek if it is not from *wéḱs), whereas when it was substituted for the original consonant, the result was *séḱs (Sanskrit, Latin, Germanic, Lithuanian and OCS)."
