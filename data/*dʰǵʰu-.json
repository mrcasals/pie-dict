  "lemma": "*dʰǵʰu-",
  "etymology": [
    "Found only in East Indo-European languages, namely the Armenian, Greek and Baltic branches. The Indo-Iranian term was presumably lost and was replaced by *mátsyas, possibly from the BMAC substrate. Kloekhorst has construed the root as *dǵʰuH- and connected it with another root *deǵʰ- (“liquid?”). Compare Old Irish deug (“drink, draught, potion”), Lithuanian dažaĩ (“paint, dye”)."
