  "lemma": "*h₂ówis",
  "etymology": [
    "Lycian and Tocharian reflexes necessarily point to *h₂ówis. However, this noun is usually reconstructed as *h₃éwis in order to \"account for the Anatolian and Armenian h- and for pervasive o-vocalism, in spite of the Tocharian form, which then remains unexplained\" (Lubotsky). Alternatively, acrostatic ablauting *h₂ówi- ~ *h₂éwi- paradigm can be reconstructed (such as the one presented here in the declension table), and then one can \"assume that the attested forms have the o-vocalism of the former variant, and the h- of the latter\" (Lubotsky). Compare with Hebrew כֶּבֶשׂ‎ (“kéves”).\n",
    "R. A. Pooth argues that the word has the original meaning \"one who produces clothing (from wool)\". See *h₂éwis.\n"
